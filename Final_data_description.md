# New York Food Truck Project

## Data

In this project the neighborhoods of Manhattan will be considered.

Hence we will use the .json file for New York data (https://cocl.us/new_york_datase) and will extract out the information about the neighborhoods for the Manhattan borough.

For every neighborhood in Manhattan, the 50 most visited places within the radius of 500 meters will be determined. As we consider both the number of attractions are the competitors in the area, the ratio between the attractions and the food places will be determined and will be ranked. Foursquare location data will be used in this determination.

Based on the ranking the best location/locations to place the food truck will be decided.
